# CricketAnalytics-Project

This project was developed with Abhinay Krishna Vellala as part of research project in Sports Analytics course at LIU.
In this project, we have implemented feature engineering on ball-to-ball data of cricket league (IPL) from 2008 until 2016 for each player and clustered them
to predict the strength of each team for the next season(2017). The strongest team is predicted as winner of the next season which turned to be actual winners of IPL 2017.
